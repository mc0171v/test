These xsd files were downloaded from:

    http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/dtd-schemas/schemas

The xml catalog file (catalog.xml) is used to define the local locations of imported schemas.

Note that the local location of imported schemas is cached somewhere in the ~/.gradle directory and problems
can arise if the catalog file is updated with a different location - in which case, blow away the ~/.gradle directory.

The w3 directory contains xml.xsd, downloaded from http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd.
